<h1 id="excelformeditor">Excel Form Editor</h1>

<h2 id="whatisit">What is it?</h2>

<p>As the name suggests, it is a program that helps you edit excel forms.</p>

<p>If you wanted to fill it in by yourself, you would have to write 1 letter at a time and then change the cell manually.</p>

<p>EFE makes this task a peace of cake.</p>

<h2 id="howdoesitwork">How does it work?</h2>

<p>In order to let the program know which fields you want to fill, you`ll have to color-code them. </p>

<p>Just select a bunch of cells and change their background to some color,</p>

<p>then select other field and color it with different color, then keep alternating them (like: red->black->red),</p>

<p>those could be any colors, the program only cares that they are different, to identify the start of the new field.</p>

<p>The program then generates a config file for your form, which contains information about all of the fields you chose(colored).</p>
